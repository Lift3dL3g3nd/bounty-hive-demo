# Demo Schemas

This demo repo intentionally avoids shipping full internal schemas.
The purpose is to show:
- folder structure
- redaction manifests
- lifecycle gating fields
- artifact reference patterns

In the real system, schemas are versioned and policy-locked, and Core treats Engine output as untrusted input.
