# Repository Freeze Notice

This repository is intentionally **frozen** at version **demo-v1**.

It exists solely to demonstrate Bounty-Hive’s:
- safe-by-default vulnerability disclosure model
- lifecycle-gated artifact visibility
- redaction and validation discipline
- audit-oriented governance guarantees

## What “frozen” means

- No new features will be added
- No existing artifacts will be modified
- No pull requests or issues are accepted
- Any future changes, if required, will be introduced only as a **new, explicitly versioned release**

This ensures reviewers can rely on the contents of this repository as a **stable reference artifact**.

## Scope & safety

All contents are:
- non-actionable
- fully redacted pre-purchase
- intended for evaluation by security leadership, privacy teams, and legal/compliance reviewers

No exploit instructions or real targets are included.
